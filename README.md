# TDD_SlotConfiguration
In 5G NR, slot configuration can be done in a static, semi-static or fully dynamic fashion. The Static and  semi-static slot configuration is done using RRC while dynamic slot configuration is done using PDCCH  DCI. 
The rapid evolution of wireless communication technologies has led to the advent of 5G NR, promising 
unparalleled data rates, lower latency, and enhanced network efficiency. This study delves into slot 
configuration in 5G NR, studying its impact on system performance, resource utilization, and overall 
network capabilities.
